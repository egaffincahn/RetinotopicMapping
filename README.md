# RetinotopicMapping

My retinotopic mapping suite uses a GUI system for PsychToolbox in MATLAB to create scanner-ready, Eyelink eye tracking-capable stimuli geared toward mapping early visual cortex.

Among its capabilities are an angularly moving wedge, an eccentricity-mapping annulus, and vertical/horizontal meridian mapping wedges. It can also create stimuli that are biased for the parvo and magnocellular systems by altering the color scheme and temporal frequency, as well as a 3D moving dot array for mapping motion areas. Nearly all of the parameters are available to be altered to your specifications. 

*InitializeSuite.m is the main file that you will interact with, and it contains the help info.*
